Ahhh yes, Semantic UI. A FREE, polished, UI framework that allows you to create fun, yet professional websites for almost any occasion. Whether it be for your small business for clothing, survey taking, or even for your personal resume, Semantic UI does it all!

## Now let's dive a little deeper. What makes Semantic UI different from any other UI framework?

As mentioned on the Semantic UI homepage, Semantic UI "treats words and classes as exchangeable concepts. Classes use syntax from natural languages like noun/modifier relationships, word order, and plurality to link concepts intuitively." In my personal experience, this makes coding a lot more natural for me when trying to implement fancy buttons and such. That being said, there is also the utilization of simple phrases called "behaviors" that trigger functionality. Any arbitrary decision in a component is included as a setting to allow developers the freedom to modify what they please.

## After a week of using Semantic UI ...

To say the least, it inspires my creative side to come out and try to experiment with web design. Through majority of my time in college, although they tried to make it fun and entertaining, the material primarily focused on the "logical" side of coding and just how we practice the functionality of programming languages. If I had to describe Semantic, it makes coding feel like a secondary priority while the main priority is to give the user freedom and accessibility to customize a user interface.

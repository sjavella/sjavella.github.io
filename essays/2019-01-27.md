## Everyone studying in Computer Science wants to be a good coder.

It's a given. I, as well as many others, want to be proficient in coding. As for what programming languages, I strive to be relatively familiar with all programming languages, but I aim to master a single programming language (depending on what is necessary for the job). Coding takes up a lot of my time as it is, so I have to use my time on the right things. If I were to spend an equal amount of time on every coding language, sure I can be good at a lot of programming languages, but I personally feel that in order to do bigger things at an efficient rate, it's extremely important to have that one programming language that you can just know by heart.

## Lifestyle changes.

Previously touching upon the subject of time commitment in being a Software Engineer, I strive to make ends meet when it comes to my way of life and having a career. Growing up, I was always passionate about video games and I still am up to this day. Any free time I have is invested into playing video games with my friends. With this passion and pursuit for a career, I am really interested in going to some sort of gaming development company in hopes that my passion will drive me to a successful career.

## Trying new things in new places.

It has been an interest of mine to travel to places outside of America to see how the Software Engineering industry, or even the technology industry, is compared to us. Places like Asia, more specifically China, inspires me to get out there and see what new things are being invented and if I am interested enough to look for a career in those particular areas. Personally I don't travel as much in general either, so stepping out of my comfort zone definitely a step in the right direction to do great things.

## It is gonna be a loooong journey.

Being only a sophomore in college as im writing this, although I am somewhat nervous about what is yet to come and the obstacles I may face, I am eager to learn so much more about what it takes to be a Software Engineer as well as the possible opportunities that come my way.

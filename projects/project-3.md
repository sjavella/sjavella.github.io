As an office assistant in the UH System Institutional Research and Analysis Office (IRAO), every now and then I receive projects from IT Specialists for the purpose of benefitting our department as well as receiving real-world experience as a coder. For the past couple of months I have been chipping at this long term project on the side and I really appreciate how it consistently refreshes me on Java since I am always learning new coding languages every semester in school.

## What have I accomplished so far?

So far I have been introduced to Regex (Regular Expression), a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.

I have been slowly getting used to it as eventually I will be utilizing it to parse an access log such as this:
